                <p>
                    It all started with a single pane of glass in the early 1990s. Back then, our founder was just a young tradesman with a truck, a toolbox, and a drive to do things right. He learned the business the old-school way â€” job by job, hand by hand, in neighborhoods across South Texas. Over time, his reputation grew: fast work, clean edges, and no-nonsense service. As the years rolled on and the city of San Antonio expanded along the I-35 corridor, so did his experience â€” from simple residential windows to full commercial installations and high-end custom projects. In 2024, that decades-long journey evolved into something new: Glass 35. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Named after the very highway that helped shape our service routes and our work ethic, Glass 35 stands for three things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strength â€“ in our materials and our word</li>
                    <li>Speed â€“ because your time matters</li>
                    <li>Texas Pride â€“ weâ€™re from here, and we work like it ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Today, Glass 35 blends over 30 years of experience with modern tools and a team of reliable professionals. Whether itâ€™s a broken window, a dream shower, or a full glass storefront, weâ€™re here to get the job done â€” fast, fair, and done right the first time. Because glass should be the last thing you worry about.
